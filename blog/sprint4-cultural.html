      Engaging with the concept of neuroplasticity is helpful because in thinking about the concept itself we are actually practising the act of building neuroplasticity. The concept of Neuroplasticity is about how, even in adulthood we can build and change the neural pathways in our brains to improve our helath and to learn new skills and ideas. Neuroplasticity can be improved by practising by new things as well as changing how we think. So, actively thinking about how neural pathways can be changed and developed helps build our neuroplasticity as well as helping to motivate us to engage in new skills and practises because we understand the benefits.
    </p>

      I think that engaging with the concept of neuroplasticity can really help me to approach new challenges with a positive attitude and the belief that I can learn new skills and concepts. I think I can also draw on the ways to build neuroplasticity to motivate me to practice coding regularly to build my neural pathways.
    </p>

      We can increase our neuroplasticity by practising skills over and over again to build up neural pathways and practising skills in lots of different ways. We can also use an understanding of neuroplasticity to change our perspective on how we can learn and the benefits of practising new skills. We can also try and learn new skills by relating them to things we are already confident with such as using analogies of everyday activities to explain new concepts. Engaging in specific activities like making music, excercise, playng games and learning new languages are really goo ways of building and strengthening our neural pathways to improve our wellbeing.

      Growth mindset is about how we view challenges and the learning process. With a growth mindset we dont react to learning something new or not knowing something with a sense of failure and the desire to give up but we instead approach the new skill or knowledge with curiosity and the belief that we can master it with effort. This is critical in learning new skills like coding becasue it will inevitably be challenging but instead of feeling defeated by that struggle like we would with a fixed mindset we can instead approach the challenge with resilience and a motivation to increase our knowledge.

      In exploring growth mindset and neuroplasticity I think I really realised that I had been riased with a fixed mindset and that I really struggle with learning new things because if I cant do something it immediately makes me have negative thoughts and affects my mood. I think alot of this is related to perfectionism, validation for achieving rather than trying aswell as having a tendency towards depression. I knew all this about myself but the idea that I can choose to approach coding and anything else I want to learn with the belief that I will understand it and that I can put in the effort is really exciting and motivating. Its giving me alot of hope about the future.

      I will definitley integrate the ideas of neuroplasticity and growth mindset into my learning plan. i think the most effective way to do this will be by changing my respose to difficult tasks by seeing them as necessary steps in the learning process and also by letting myself off the hook to be 'perfect' at things and instead just focus on not giving up. I can also see how changing your thinking about thinking relates to the concept of mindfullness and I want to keep growing my abilty to notice the negative thoughts and emotional responses that come up when I am engaging in a difficult task and practise conciously choosing a different response.
