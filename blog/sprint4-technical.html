    <p>
      I got blocked on the problem in the reflection questions for this sprint about testing where we were given an example of test driven development and had to provide the code to make the test work. The required code was in fact a simple sum function but I got stuck on it for quite a long time. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      Although I understood the test, I think working backwards like that to create code when I am still so new to it meant that I overcomplicated the solution in my mind and spent alot of time trying to come up with the code and thinking that my intial, simple solution wasnt right. I also got stuck becasue I tried to test the test in the browser and like using console.log, when I am not 100% confident with a problem solving technique then I can use it incorrectly and think that my solution is wrong when in fact I am just testing it wrong. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      I eventually asked my peers what they got for their solution to this problem and whether or not they had 'tested' it against the provided test code. Although they had written the same solution as I had they had thought it was so simple that they didnt need to test it and so hadnt got stuck on the task the way I had. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      It was helpful however to check this with my peers and get a reality check on how I am often responding with panic to these tests which stops me form realising I know the answer. I felt a little silly asking for help but also relieved that I was on the right track when my peers reassured me.

          <h3>Elegant Problem Solving:</h3> 
        </figcaption>
        <img class="blog-img" src="JS olympics screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of the code and pseudocode used for javascript function that creates and object with properties">
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>
      I solved the last problem in the JS olympics Kata with an elegant solution that was possibly becasue it was an easier challenge than the previous ones! But I still felt happy because all the other problems in that Kata and the couple before that I had had to look at the solutions to understand where I was going wrong first. The last problem in the JS olympics Kata that we were given this sprint involved creating a function that would take aseries of properties and return a new athlete object to add to our existing array of athlete objects from earlier in the Kata.
    </p>
    <p>
       I first looked at this problem and thought it would be very complicated like I had found most of the previous ones to be but I started by trying to pass each test related to this problem which was a different method than I had been using for the previous problems. Because the tests in this Kata were quite complicated I had been writing my code based on the instructions on the github task page. But for this last problem I decided to look at the tests and try and pass each one individually. This helped to break down the problem into smaller steps than I would instinctively have done which I relasied was very helpful. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Focusing on passing each test for a problem rather than getting the whole problem right in one go helped me to realise that the solution to this problem was actually incredibly simple and in trying to write a sort of pseudocode for it I actually ended up solving it. All the function required was for an object variable to be defined and assigned to a value of all the properties that would be passed into the array. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was stoked when I passed the test with this solution and it was a breakthrough to realise that my approach of breaking down the problem using the tests, writing pseudocode (and the fact that it was a comparatively simple problem) helped me to solve this easily without having to refer to the solution code. I think this was also a useful reminder that if I feel overwhelmed by a problem I can overcomplicate it but by really stopping to break it down, when I want to jump ahead, will actually save me time in the long run becasue some challenges may be easier than I realise at first glance.

    <h4>How confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process?</h4>
    <div>
      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        I used pseudocode on almost every problem in the Kata this sprint. I found it helpful for both laying out the steps to figure out a problem in advance and also for explainging why a slution worked especially if I hadnt been able to find the solution on my own and had to refer to the solution provided. I feel like I learnt alot about how to use pseudocode to my advantage in this sprint and will continue to use it as one of my main problem solving techniques.
      </p>
    </div>  
    <div>
      <h3>Trying something</h3>
      <p>
        This is the technique I used to approach all the problems this sprint. I always tried to write some code and run the tests, change the code and run again over and over. I think I naturally take this approach to solving iny problem where I jump staright into trying solutions rather than starting with a plan. If anything I robably need to plan a bit more so that when I try things I don't get stuck in the details.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>
        I liked this method when I learnt about it in the prep curriculum and sprint 1. I think it makes alot of sense. I definitely could utilise this technique more as I really only used it by talking outloud to myself and didn't use it consistently this sprint or last even though I found effective in a similar way to pseudocode as a way of getting clear on the problem. I think although I feel confident using this method it would be helpful to practise it more by writing the problem out or asking someone else to listen to me explain it.
      </p>
    </div>  
    <div>
      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
      <p>
        I feel less confident with this technique than the others but I did practise it alot this psrint and can feel myslef gaining more understanding. A few times last sprint I googled the meaning of certain error messages and that helped m,e to uderstand them more. Some of the common ones I got this sprint were syntax related and I feel confident mostly to work out where the problem is there because in the repl.it console at least (I'm not sure if this is the same in the browser tools but I think it is?) the error message tells you where the error is and often what exactly it is e.g. and extra bracket. However, some error messages are quite cryptic so those are the ones I feel less confident about.
      </p>
    </div>  
    <div>
      <h3> Console.logging</h3>
      <p>
        Console.logging is probably the technique I used least this sprint although I still tried to use it but didnt really get any help from it. I thibnk I dont fully understand the parameters in which it works so I did a bit ofresearch after I had completed the Kata becasue in reading other people's blogs I realised it was helping people alot. I discovered (which I had somehow not taken in ) that console.log works only on objects and through playng around with it in my completed kata I learnt a bit more about the parameters for its use within a function and how to test that things are working so I will continue to try and build my knowledge of this one.
      </p>
    </div>  
    <div>
      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p>
        Love a google! Although I have found it trickier to google javascipt queries compared to html becasue I have less of a grasp on the basics I have googled alot this sprint and it has been really helpful in gaining more understanding of things I had already learnt and also learning new things. Its becoming easier to interpret information about javascript from a google search although I have struggled to find recources that explain things in really simple terms without relying on terminology - this is actually where other students' blogs have come in handy!
      </p>
    </div>  
    <div>
      <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
      <p>
       I feel comfortable asking my peers for help via slack and in person though in person I am wary of nopt wanting to interrupt people in their work but I will do so if I really need it and people seem happy to help.
      </p>
    </div> 
    <div>
      <h3> Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p>
       I feel comfortable asking coaches for help though I have only done this with Genevieve as I cant remember who the other coaches are! Again, I am aware that they have a lot of students to help and also work different office hours.
      </p>
    </div> 
    <div>
      <h3> Improving your process with reflection</h3>
      <p>
       I have been pretty consistently using the reflection practices that were suggested to us in the prep material where we set a goal and describe a challenge each day. On top of the compulsory reflections I found this a really useful way to be concious about how I am going, what I am learning (though I could be better at reflecting on specifics to help them stick) and how I am responding to differnt challenges.
