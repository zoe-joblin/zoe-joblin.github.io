    <h4>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h4>

    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <p>
      I have thought a bit about the kind of role I would like to do but am yet to discover the breadth of things I could do with coding skills. As I progress through foundations and into bootcamp I feel more excited by the skills I am learning and can see more clearly how I could work in a web development role. But for now, the same sort of vision applies from my foundations learning plan in relation to the environment I want to work in and how fullfilling the work is but I am less fixed on what kind of role I have. I know I can go back into government or get contract work very easily once I finish at Dev academy but that feels a bit like going backwards so I hope that I find something exciting and different to use my new skills in.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths, limitations and challenges</h3>
    <p>
      I have developed some new skills through foundations that I belive will help me to manage some of my limitations in Bootcamp such as mindfullness and awareness of my thoughts and feelings in relation to learning. I still think I will need to work hard to build my focus and motivation, perserverence and capacity to manage negative emotions. I have definitely been surprised at how much I have learnt and feel good about my learning and problem solving abilities. I think the work I have done to change my perspective on challenging tasks is paying off and I am proud of that. <br>
      I think that some of my biggest challenges in Bootcamp willbe managing my time, energy and emotions so that I dont get overwhelmed and being able to deal with the inevitable stresses and chellenges in a healthy way. I think a big part of doing this well will be about being aware of what I am feeling and communcating it in a timely way to other students and staff as well as in my personal life.
    </p>
    <h3>Human Skills</h3>
    <p>
      I still want to develop the skills I identified in my foundations learning plan - resilience in managing the stress that will come with bootcamp. I think there will be many parts to this including self reflection, focus, boundary setting, communication and mindfullness.
    </p>
    <h3>Expectations of EDA team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect that I will be able to communicate with the bootcamp team when I am having challenges and get support and guidance. I expect that I will get regular, constructive feedback about how I am progressing and any areas I may need to work on.
    </p>
    <h3>Expectations of myself</h3>
    <p>
      I commit to being prepared for the curriculum each week and coming in with a positive attitude. I commit to being honest about how I am feeling and when I dont understand something. I commit to perservering with challenges and not giving up when things are difficult. I commit to attending all classes and completing my work to the best of my abilities. I commit to treating myself and others with compassion and communicating clearly about my expectations and my limits. I commit to asking for help from my peers and Bootcamp staff when I am struggling.
    </p> 
    <h3>Asking for help</h3>
    <p>
      I will commit to asking my peers and tutors for help when I am struggling with something if it is taking me longer than expected and I will not wait until the last minute to do this. I will use slack to communicate with them during foundations.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <p>
      My vision for my career isn’t specific to a role but rather the kind of environment I want to work in and the work I want to do. I would like to work in an NGO or social enterprise or even private sector on projects that I believe in, which will benefit our communities in Aotearoa. I want to have a diverse set of skills that I can bring to these kinds of projects or organisations and I want to do work that is creative, innovative, connected and fulfilling. This may involve web development, project management or analyst type roles or a combination of things where I can continuously learn and grow and collaborate with compassionate and energised people. 
    </p>
    <h3>Human Skills</h3>
    <p>
      I would like to get better at taking feedback and being resilient when I am not good at something straight away. I also want to develop my ability to ask for help. Another thing that is related to this is having an optimistic and accepting approach to problem solving. I know that I can be overly critical or have too high expectations for myself and others so if I can approach new learning situations and challenges with an optimistic and curious perspective I know I will have more resilience and energy to get through this programme.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
    <p>
      I believe my strengths are predominantly in problem solving and creative/critical thinking; this allows me to be efficient with tasks and processes and also see ways to improve them. I believe that my biggest challenge is being overly sensitive to other people’s perceptions, opinions and energy which affects my focus and motivation. I think this can also be a strength but I need to get better at how I respond to things I find challenging in order to overcome them.
    </p>
    <h3>Managing my workload</h3>
    <p>
      I will manage my workload by planning my weeks in advance using the timeboxes set out for each task and allocating them to each day of the week. I will be proactive about giving myself extra time for work that I know will be challenging so that I can meet deadlines. I will aim to work out of the house most mornings at the Wellington campus or library as I have learned that this helps me to focus more and for longer. I will try and limit distractions during my study hours.
    </p> 
    <h3>Asking for help</h3>
    <p>
      I will commit to asking my peers and tutors for help when I am struggling with something if it is taking me longer than expected and I will not wait until the last minute to do this. I will use slack to communicate with them during foundations.
    </p>
    <h3>Expectations of EDA team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect that I will be able to talk to my tutor once a week and get advice and guidance on the areas I am struggling with as well as feedback about the things I am doing well. I expect that I will be able to go to my tutor if something has meant that I can't complete my work on time and will be able to negotiate a way forward.
    </p>
    <h3>Other commitments</h3>
    <p>
      I look after my niece on Thursday afternoons and sometimes have daytime appointments and errands during the week but will aim to work between the hours of 9 and 5 every weekday and make up time on the weekends.
