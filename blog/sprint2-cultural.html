            </div>
            <div>
        <h4>Future Plans</h4>
       <p>My vision for my career isn’t specific to a role but rather the kind of environment I want to work in and the work I want to do. I would like to work in an NGO or social enterprise or even private sector on projects that I believe in, which will benefit our communities in Aotearoa. I want to have a diverse set of skills that I can bring to these kinds of projects or organisations and I want to do work that is creative, innovative, connected and fulfilling. This may involve web development, project management or analyst type roles or a combination of things where I can continuously learn and grow and collaborate with compassionate and energised people. </p>
        <h4>Human Skills</h4>
        <p>I would like to get better at taking feedback and being resilient when I am not good at something straight away. I also want to develop my ability to ask for help. Another thing that is related to this is having an optimistic and accepting approach to problem solving. I know that I can be overly critical or have too high expectations for myself and others so if I can approach new learning situations and challenges with an optimistic and curious perspective I know I will have more resilience and energy to get through this programme.</p>
        <h4>Strengths and Weaknesses</h4>
        <p>I believe my strengths are predominantly in problem solving and creative/critical thinking; this allows me to be efficient with tasks and processes and also see ways to improve them. I believe that my biggest challenge is being overly sensitive to other people’s perceptions, opinions and energy which affects my focus and motivation. I think this can also be a strength but I need to get better at how I respond to things I find challenging in order to overcome them.</p>
        <h4>Managing my workload</h4>
        <p>I will manage my workload by planning my weeks in advance using the timeboxes set out for each task and allocating them to each day of the week. I will be proactive about giving myself extra time for work that I know will be challenging so that I can meet deadlines. I will aim to work out of the house most mornings at the Wellington campus or library as I have learned that this helps me to focus more and for longer. I will try and limit distractions during my study hours.</p> 
        <h4>Asking for help</h4>
        <p>I will commit to asking my peers and tutors for help when I am struggling with something if it is taking me longer than expected and I will not wait until the last minute to do this. I will use slack to communicate with them during foundations.</p>
        <h4>Expectations of EDA team</h4>
        <p>I expect that I will be able to talk to my tutor once a week and get advice and guidance on the areas I am struggling with as well as feedback about the things I am doing well. I expect that I will be able to go to my tutor if something has meant that I can't complete my work on time and will be able to negotiate a way forward.</p>
        <h4>Other commitments</h4>
        <p>I look after my niece on Thursday afternoons and sometimes have daytime appointments and errands during the week but will aim to work between the hours of 9 and 5 every weekday and make up time on the weekends.</p>
