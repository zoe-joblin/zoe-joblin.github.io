      <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When I push through fear of failure I can achieve more than I thought</li>
        <li>I had a very fixed mindset about my ability to learn soft skills</li>
        <li>I never really learned how to learn before</li>
      </ul>

      <h3> What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>
        Self awareness including knowing what drives you (values) and how you affect others (empathy) is key to being able to collaborate and work well with others. These are core skills that employers look for in addition to coding ability. In terms of learning, having an awareness of our thoughts and feelings is very useful becasue it allows us to adapt them in order to overcome challenges.

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
       The most surprising thing is that I thought I knew it all already but I didnt. Coming from a career background that has focussed more on soft skills and being quite a sensitive and socially driven person I thought alot of the core skills challenges would come easily to me. But in exploring the core tasks I learnt alot about my strengths and weaknesses and where I can develop my emotional skills which will actually be what helps me most in learning code.

      <h3> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
       None of it was particularly challenging because it wasnt like solving a problem but alot of the tasks definitely involved time and effort to complete. The one I had to work most on was probably the identity, values and culture blog becasue I didn't really know off the top of my head what any of those things were.

      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        Becasue adult learning is hard and this course is particularly fast-paced and intensive. The things that help with adult learning are emotional skills. Its important to be able to build those skills to make the most of this course and especially to realise that learning happens in the struggle and frustration when you feel you cant do something and being able to embrace that is the key.

      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p>
       No not at all. I dont think I would have made the progress I have with the tech components if I hadn't had the core curriculum alongside it to help me take a concious apporach to learning. Especially as someone coming into code entirely fresh and with the potential to have those fixed mindset thoughts about not being the kind of person who codes, its been realy helpful to be encouraged to take the opposite perspective.
