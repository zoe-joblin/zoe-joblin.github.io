         We have been set the task of researching emotional intelligence and writing a blog post about ourinsights on this topic. 
         Emotional Intelligence is something I came into this course thinking I knew more about than the tech curriculum 
         but having done the core curriculum tasks so far I have realised that although "soft skills" like relating to people come more 
         naturally to me becase of my cultural influences and previous job types I have never worked conciously to develop or practice emotional intelligence.</p>
       <p>
       When I did a google search on emotional intelligence it came up with several definitions which revolved around the ability to have awareness of your own and others feelings. 
       I then found some information on one of the<a href="https://www.allright.org.nz/articles/emotional-intelligence">NZ Mental health foundation</a>websites about the different skills associated with emotional intelligence:</p>
       <ul class="ordered-list">
         <li>Self-Awareness</li>
         <li>Self-Regulation</li>
         <li>Motivation</li>
         <li>Empathy</li>
         <li>Social Skills</li>
       </ul>
       <p> Refelcting on this list I realised that although some of these skills come naturally to me (empathy, social skills and self-awareness to a lesser extent)
        I really struggle with motivation and self-regulation. This is a useful and surprising insight. I realised I hadn't conciously engaged with what emotional intelligence is before this, 
        I had just assumed I knew what it was and that because I have good social skills I am automatically emotionally intelligent when there is actually alot more to it. 
        This aligns with what I discovered through exploring my strengths and weaknesses and will help me to work more conciously on 
        improving my self-regulation and motivation. I have already been working on emotional regulation for myself with things like mindfullness and positive self-talk but it is going to be useful 
        to connect these skills back to the idea of emotional intelligence and how they will benefit all my relationships and overall wellbeing. So thanks Dev Academy :)

       <p>I also completed a<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/ei-quiz.htm">short quiz</a>to assess emotional intelligence and I got an average score which indicated I have some emotioanl intelligence but had room to improve which aligns with my self-reflection.</p>
