       Emotional intelligence is defined as the ability to have awareness of your own and others feelings. Emotional intelligence or emotional quotient (EQ) is different to IQ becasue instead of focusing on academic knowledge it focuses on our behaviour and the skills that help us to build connections and manage our emotions in a healthy way. High EQ, although not directly related to intelligence in the traditionl western view is in fact beneficial to our productivity and our work outputs as well as our quality of life becasue it improves things like focus, our ability to collaborate with others and to overcome conflict and challenges in order to perservere. It can also help us to maintain a calm disposition in distressing situations and build confidence.</p>
       <p>I found some information on one of the<a href="https://www.allright.org.nz/articles/emotional-intelligence">NZ Mental health foundation</a>websites about the different skills associated with emotional intelligence:</p>
       <ul class="ordered-list">
         <li>Self-Awareness</li>
         <li>Self-Regulation</li>
         <li>Motivation</li>
         <li>Empathy</li>
         <li>Social Skills</li>
       </ul>
       <p> Refelcting on this list I realised that although some of these skills come naturally to me (empathy, social skills and self-awareness to a lesser extent) I really struggle with motivation and self-regulation. This is a useful and surprising insight. I realised I hadn't conciously engaged with what emotional intelligence is before this, I had just assumed I knew what it was and that because I have good social skills I am automatically emotionally intelligent when there is actually alot more to it. 
         </p>
      <p>This aligns with what I discovered through exploring my strengths and weaknesses and will help me to work more conciously on improving my self-regulation and motivation. I have already been working on emotional regulation for myself with things like mindfullness and positive self-talk but it is going to be useful to connect these skills back to the idea of emotional intelligence and how they will benefit all my relationships, my study and overall wellbeing. So thanks Dev Academy :)
