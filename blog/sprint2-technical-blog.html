    <p> Websites are made using three main types of code: html (bulding blocks), CSS (styling) and javascript (makes things happen). CSS is used to style websites by combining it with html. The basic layout of css is like this:</p>
     <figure><img class="blog-img" src="./Screen Shot 2021-07-02 at 1.30.01 PM.png" alt="CSS syntax image"></figure>
    <p>In the example below, the selector is h1 which is the html code used to create a large heading on a webpage. If we use h1 as the selector in our css code then we can change the style of our large headings by changing things like font size and colour. 
    See two examples below where the selector is h1 so the large heading on our website is being styled and the CSS colour property is what is being changed.</p>
    <figure><img class="blog-img" src="./blue heading.png" alt="blue text on a web page that reads 'heading' and the CSS code that made it">
        <img class="blog-img" src="./red heading.png" alt="red text on a web page that reads 'heading' and the CSS code that made it"></figure>
    <p>Classes and ID’s are two types of selectors that can be used when styling a wesbite with CSS. 
        These two selectors allow you to style specific elements on your website rather than applying the same styling to all elements of the same type. 
        For example, if you had a website with five different h1 headings you could set their font size
        to something like 16 pixels and the colour to black using the CSS layout above. 
        However, if you wanted one of the headings to be blue and the rest to remain black you couldn’t do this just by styling the h1 element. 
        Instead, you would need to use either a class selector or an ID selector. 
        The main difference between a class selector and id selector is that a class can apply to more than one element e.g. two different h1 headings, 
        but an id can only ever apply to one element.
    </p>
    <p>The best practice for writing ID and class selectors is below:
