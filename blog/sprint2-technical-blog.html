    <p> Websites are made using three main types of code: html (bulding blocks), CSS (styling) and javascript (makes things happen). CSS is used to style websites by combining it with html. The basic layout of css is like this:</p>
     <figure>(syntax image)</figure>
    <p>In this example, the selector is h1 which is the code used to create a large heading on a webpage using html. If we use h1 as the selector in our css code then we can change the style of our large headings by changing things like font size and colour. 
    See two examples below where the selector is h1 so the large heading on our website is being changed by the CSS colour declarations.</p>
    <figure>(Two images of css code and the effects they have)</figure>
    <p>Class and ID’s are two types of selectors that can be used when styling a wesbite with CSS. These two selectors allow you to style specific elements on your website rather than applying the same styling to all elements of the same type. For example, if you had a website with five different large headings ( called h1 elements) you could set the font size of these headings to something like 16pixels and the colour to black using h1 as the selector (name) for the css but if you wanted one of the headings to be blue and the rest to remain black you couldn’t do this just by styling the h1 element. 
        So if you wanted to change one of the h1 headings to be blue instead of black you would need to use either a class element for all the h1 elements but you couldn’t make them different from each other
