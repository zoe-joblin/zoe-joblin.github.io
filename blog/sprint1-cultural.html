        <h4>Core Values</h4>
        <p>I struggled to think of what my core values are off the top of my head but some obvious ones came up initially such as kindness and respect. I was also unsure what constitutes a value so researched some approaches to uncovering your core values and I did a quiz to help me identify some. The ones I came up with that resonated with me were the following:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Helpfulness - encompasses generosity and service</li>
            <li>Respect - encompasses kindness and compassion</li>
            <li>Family - encompasses connection, belonging and service</li>
            <li>Peace and Security - are similar to me and relate to comfort, safety, structure and wellbeing.</li>
        </ul>
       <p>I was surprised that some values didn’t come out for me in doing the quiz such as creativity, growth and independence but I realised that I would rank these as less important to me than the values above in terms of how they affect my behaviour. 
        I think I deprioritise these other values as I see them as more individual, and they are often trumped by my stronger collective and survival based values, but they definitely drive some of my behaviour and choices when the other values are less relevant to a given situation.
    </p>
        <h4>Ethical decision-making</h4>
        <p>Someone close to me was very mentally unwell last year and spent time in hospital. I had to work with their family to get them medical help even though the person themselves didn't believe that they needed it. I had to weigh up my very strong value for respect for other people’s choices, my desire to keep the peace and my empathy for the situation this person was in with what my own instinct and experience told me that medical care was the best thing for them for everyone around them. It broke my heart to make this decision to get them help and the person was very angry at me and their family but they eventually got better and I know that it was the best decision although it was a hard one.
        </p>
        <h4>Cultural Identity</h4>
        <p>Some of the main cultural influences on me would be my religious schooling, family background, work background, sexuality, socioeconomic status and ethnicity. 
        I went to Catholic schools and my parents have worked a lot in the creative arts, both of which have informed my liberal and community focused values. 
        I am a Pakeha New Zealander which means I have experienced privileges that other people haven't and it has formed a large part of my identity which includes unconscious bias that I have to actively work to unlearn. 
        My family lost a lot of money when I was younger which meant I experienced a lot of the privileges of being middle class such as a good education but did not have access to much money or resources as a teenager and young adult. This has influenced the way I relate to money as well as making me value things like social welfare and the importance of food and housing security to a person’s wellbeing. 
        I identify as queer which informs alot of how I see myself and others, my political values and beliefs about open-mindedness as well as my social circle and interests. 
        Social justice and politics are important to me which I think comes from my maternal grandparents who are Irish and have always been highly political because of their cultural experience of oppression. I also place a lot of value on exercising my right to vote because of their influence and how I vote is driven by my values of care and respect for other people rather than by what will benefit me personally. I think these values of respect and service have also been strengthened by working mostly in social services and the public sector and going to Catholic schools which instills strong values. 
        Family and community are very important to me but I also value independence which I think are concepts that can sometimes be at odds with each other. I think this comes from my parents' different cultural backgrounds; where my dad’s family grew up in small-town New Zealand and were religiously/culturally Presbyterian, my mum was raised by irish Catholic parents in England and then New Zealand. My dad’s family background values self-reliance, stoicism, hard work and individual success whereas my mum’s cultural background values faith, community, family, belonging and celebration. Both my parents value creativity, art and beauty which has influenced the ways I find joy and connection.

        <h4>Strengths and Weaknesses</h4>
        <p>I had some ideas about what my strengths and weaknesses were but I also did some quizzes and asked my friends and family for feedback to get some different perspectives.
        Some of the strengths that I got from people who know me and the quizzes I did are:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Warm and empathetic</li>
            <li>Able to dapt and connect with a wide range of people</li> 
            <li>Problem solver</li>
            <li>Leader but able to delegate and support well</li>
            <li>Efficient</li> 
            <li>Honest</li>
            <li>Innovative</li>
            <li>Imaginative and artistic</li>
            <li>Charming</li>
            <li>Passionate</li>
            <li>Curious</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of the weaknesses that I got from people who know me and the quizzes I did are:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>I put others first too much</li>
            <li>I make impulsive decisions</li> 
            <li>I struggle with conflict</li>
            <li>I need clear and requested feedback in order to take it on</li>
            <li>My passion can alter if there’s a lack of respect or kindness in a group</li> 
            <li>Fiercely independent</li>
            <li>Unpredictable</li>
            <li>Easily stressed</li>
            <li>Overly competitive</li>
            <li>Fluctuating self esteem</li>
        </ul> 
         
        <h4>Learning and career development</h4>
        <p>Feedback I have received consistently in my working life is that I seem calm and caring which puts others at ease and that I am reliable, efficient and unflappable. 
        However, in previous study experiences I have struggled with focus and motivation. 
        It has been 7 years since I last studied and I think I have learnt a lot of skills for motivation and efficiency since then in my working life but stress is still a big factor for me in terms of motivation. 
        I think another of my limitations in work and study are that I don't like not knowing things or having to ask for help. 
        I am a perfectionist and struggle with learning new things because I want to be good at things straight off the bat. 
        I find it hard to receive feedback sometimes because I connect some things with my worth as a person and so criticism can feel like an attack. 
        Some of my strengths that I identified of adaptability, creativity, problem solving and passion will be helpful for this course and for moving into more flexible and creative/innovative working environments. 
        I think my perfectionism and desire to be good at things can be a good motivator if I can keep myself from feeling overwhelmed so I will need to work on accepting being a novice and taking feedback in order to really use my strengths to make the most of this course.
    </p>
        <h4>Teamwork strategies</h4>
        <p>In my previous roles there was a lot of collaboration between teams from different disciplines which could often create tension because of differing priorities and expectations. 
        I can think of a few situations where I was working with other colleagues who were all in more senior roles to me to arrange workshops in another city. The tasks involved for me were mostly logistical which was my area of expertise as a coordinator but I relied on other people such as designers who would be running the workshop to provide information to me in order to complete my tasks. The main challenge was that there had never been a good culture established between the teams of respect for each other's disciplines and understanding of how they fit together so issues around roles and responsibilities came up frequently in trying to arrange these workshops which would lead to delays or additional costs. The strategies I used to overcome these obstacles included responding to emotive or upset communication styles with a professional manner; using mindfulness techniques and taking regular breaks to remain calm when there was tension; clearly communicating what I needed and also what my responsibilities entailed; and searching for work arounds or solutions to challenges. These strategies were effective in getting the tasks completed but there were still often significant delays due to tension and miscommunications that could have been avoided if we had taken a more proactive approach to collaborating. Next time I would approach a situation like this by communicating directly and clearly about roles and responsibilities in advance, including a discussion about everyone's expectations even if this was uncomfortable in order to make sure any issues were worked out early on and we could find the most effective way to work together.
